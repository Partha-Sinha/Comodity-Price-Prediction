# Comodity-Price-Prediction

Here I have used Recurrent Neural Network to predict the prices of a comodity for the next 30 days

Steps followed in predicting the results
  - Imported the Dataset and extracted MinPrice, MaxPrice, ModalPrice
  - Replaced all the Null Values with mean values
  - Fitted and transformed and reshaped my training set
  - Intialized the RNN and input layer and the LSTM Layer and the Output Layer
  - Fitted the RNN to the Training Set
  - Predicted the price for the next 30 days
  - Exported the results to a csv file
  
The following results can be further improved by increasing the number of input layers and the LSTM Layers
